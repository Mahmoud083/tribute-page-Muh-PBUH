      <p>
        Prophet Muhammad ﷺ, born in the year 570 CE in Makkah, is the final Prophet in Islam, sent as a mercy to mankind.
        Through divine revelation over 23 years, he conveyed the Qur’an — the eternal guidance for all humanity.
        His life was a living example of compassion, justice, humility, and patience.
      </p>
      <p>
        Known for his truthfulness even before prophethood, he was called "Al-Amin" (the trustworthy). He united the Arabian Peninsula
        under the message of Tawheed (monotheism) and established a society built on equality, mercy, and justice.
      </p>
      <p>
        Muslims around the world follow his Sunnah (traditions) in every aspect of life — from personal character to public conduct.
